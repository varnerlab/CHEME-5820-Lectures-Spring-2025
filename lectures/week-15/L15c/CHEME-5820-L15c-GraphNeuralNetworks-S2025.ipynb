    "# L15c: Introdution to Graph Neural Networks\n",
    "In this lecture, we introduce the concept of [Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network) and their applications in various domains. The key concepts that student should be able to define and demonstrate from this lecture are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)__ are a type of neural network architecture specifically designed to operate on data structured as graphs, where entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges) are represented explicitly. The nodes and edges have features (attributes) that can be used to learn representations of the graph, and perform compute operations on the graph structure.\n",
    "* __Message passing in GNNs__: GNNs use a process called message passing, in which nodes update their representations by exchanging information with their neighbors, enabling the network to learn complex patterns and dependencies within the graph structure.\n",
    "* __How are GNNs different from traditional neural networks?__ Traditional neural networks typically operate on fixed-size, grid-like data structures (e.g., images, sequences), while GNNs can handle variable-sized graphs with complex connectivity patterns. This flexibility allows GNNs to model relationships and dependencies between entities more effectively, e.g., predicting user behavior in social networks by analyzing connections\n",
