    "# L15a: What comes after Transformer and LLMs?\n",
    "In this lecture we'll speculate (wildly) about what might come after Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs), see the conversation [between Yann LeCun and Bill Dally | NVIDIA GTC 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyrDM3A_YFc).\n",

    "Transformers have been a huge success, but they are not the end of the line. There are many other architectures and techniques that could be used to build even more powerful models. Let's explore a few of these possibilities, [see the review paper Schneider, J. (2024). What comes after transformers? - A selective survey connecting ideas in deep learning. ArXiv, abs/2408.00386.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13936) for a more in-depth discussion.\n",

    "The Schneider paper reviews a number of different approaches that have been proposed as alternatives to Transformers, and far-out ideas for future architectures. In this lecture we'll explore a few of these ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __State Space Models (SSMs)__ are an emerging alternative to transformers for sequence modeling, using a fixed-size latent state that enables efficient processing of extremely long inputs, such as entire books or audio streams, without the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms. While SSMs like Mamba can match or even outperform transformers at small to medium scale, they are generally less effective than transformers at tasks requiring selective attention or copying from specific parts of the input, due to their reliance on compressing information into a fixed-size state rather than dynamically attending to all previous tokens.\n",
    "* __Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)__ are brain-inspired models that process information using discrete spikes over time, offering energy-efficient and biologically plausible alternatives to transformers, especially for tasks with strong temporal dynamics148. By leveraging event-driven computation and sparse communication, SNNs can achieve high computational efficiency and are particularly well-suited for deployment on [neuromorphic hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_computing), addressing some of the limitations of transformer architectures in terms of power consumption and real-time processing6810.\n",

The LTI system is defined by the system matrices (and the initial state and input):\n",
    "* The $\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h\\times{h}}$ matrix is the state transition matrix, which describes how the state depends upon itself over time.\n",
    "* The $\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{h\\times{d_{in}}}$ matrix is the input matrix, which describes how the input vector affects the state.\n",

You may be familiar with these models from your automatic control class, where they are used to model system dynamics. In this lecture, we will focus on the discrete-time version of these models, which are often used in machine learning and signal processing applications.\n",
    "* __Single Input Single Output (SISO)__: The simplest case of a linear time invariant state space model is the single input single output (SISO) case, where there is one input $d_{in} = 1$ and one output $d_{out} = 1$ _per time step_. In this case, the system can be represented by a single transfer function, which describes the relationship between the input and output.\n",
    "* __Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)__: In the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) case, there are multiple inputs and multiple outputs. In this case, the system can be represented by a matrix of transfer functions, which describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs.\n",
