    "# L7a: Multiarm Bandit Problems\n",
    "In this lecture, we continue our discussion of online learning and will focus on the multiarm bandit problem. This lecture will introduce the following key concepts:\n",
    "* __Bandit problems__ are a class of online learning problems where an agent, during each turn opf the game, must decide which arm (choice) to pull from a set of possible choices in order to maximize its reward. Alternatively, the agent must decide which choice to make to minimize its regret. This is similar in many ways to the multiplicative weights algorithm we discussed in the previous lecture. In a bandit problem, the agent is the aggregator, the arms (choices) are the experts, and adversary is nature.\n",
    "* __Regret__ is the difference between the reward the agent would have received if it had chosen the best arm every time (in hindsight) and the reward the agent _actually_ received. Thus, the goal of the agent is to develop a _policy_ that minimizes its regret. If we only had a time machine, we could go back and make better choices.\n",
    "* __Exploration vs. exploitation__ is the key tradeoff in bandit problems. The agent must decide whether to explore (try new arms) or exploit (choose the arm that has been the best so far) during each round. This is a key tradeoff in many online learning problems. If the agent always exploits, it may miss out on better arms. Hpwever, if the agent always explores, it may not take advantage of the best arm it has found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture notes for this week will taken from Chapter 1 of \"Introduction to Multi-Armed Bandits\" by Aleksandrs Slivkins. This is a great resource for learning more about bandit problems.

    "## What is a bandit problem?\n",
    "A bandit problem another example of an online learning problem, i.e., a sequential descision problem in which an agent (us) makes a choice:\n",
    "* If the choice at time $t$ was _good_ (compared to an adversary, i.e., nature) a positive reward is given. Alternatively, if the choice was _bad_ a penalty is given. The agent must decide which arm to pull (choice to make) in order to maximize its reward (minimize its regret).\n",
    "* The memory of good (or bad) choices is stored in the agent's _policy_ which is used to make future choices. The agent must decide whether to explore (try new choices) or exploit (make a choice that has been the best so far) during each round. This is a key tradeoff in many online learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bandit problems are used in a _wide_ range of applications. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "* __Clinical Trials__: Multi-armed bandits are used to optimize the allocation of patients to different treatments, balancing the need to gather information about new treatments with the goal of minimizing patient losses. This is a real-life example of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.\n",
    "* __Financial Portfolio Design__: This approach helps in dynamically allocating investments across different assets to maximize returns while exploring new investment opportunities.\n",
    "* __Adaptive Routing__: Bandit algorithms are applied to optimize routing decisions in networks, minimizing delays by balancing exploration of new routes with exploitation of known efficient paths. Networks for us could be the internet, a metabolic network, a production network, etc.\n",
    "* __Recommendation systems__: Multi-armed bandits are utilized to personalize recommendations by iteratively selecting items to display, balancing the exploration of new items with the exploitation of well-performing ones. We encounter this in applications like Netflix, Amazon, etc.\n",

    "## Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits\n",
    "In the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, the agent must choose an action $a$ from the set of all possible actions $\\mathcal{A}$, where $\\dim\\mathcal{A} = K$ during each round $t = 1,2,\\dots,T$. The agent receives a reward $r_{a}$ from the environment, where $r_{a}$ is sampled from an unknown distribution $\\mathcal{D}_{a}$ \n",

    "3. Agent observes $r_{t}$, but nothing else. It cannot see the distribution $\\mathcal{D}_{a}$, only the _adversary_ can see this.\n",

    "## Uniform Exploration\n",
    "One simple approach to the multi-armed bandit problem is to explore each arm equally. This is called _uniform exploration_ or the _explore first_ algorithm. In this approach, the agent begins with a purley exploratory phase in which it pulls each arm $N$ times. After this exploration phase, the agent selects the arm that has the highest mean reward for the rest of the game. This is called the _exploitation phase_.\n",

    "## Epsilon-Greedy Exploration\n",
    "One issue with the _uniform exploration_ algorithm is that it may not be the best choice for all problems. For example, the performance in the exploration phase may be _bad_ if many of the arms have a large gap $\\Delta({a})$:\n",
    "* _What is this gap_? Let the (true) mean reward for each arm be $\\mu(a) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathcal{D}_{a}\\right]$, where $a\\in\\mathcal{A}$. The _best_ mean reward over the actions is $\\mu^{\\star} = \\max_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\mu_{a}$. Then, the gap $\\Delta({a}) = \\mu^{\\star} - \\mu(a)$ is the difference between the mean reward of the best arm and the mean reward of arm $a$. If the gap is _large_, the agent may miss out on a lot of reward by exploring each arm equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases of a large gap, it may be better to spread out (and interleave) the exploration and explotation phases the arms. This is the idea behind the _epsilon-greedy_ algorithm. In this algorithm, the agent chooses the best arm with probability $1-\\epsilon$ and chooses a random arm with probability $\\epsilon$. This allows the agent to explore the arms more evenly and may lead to better performance in cases where the gap is large.\n",
