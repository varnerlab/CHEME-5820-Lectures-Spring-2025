    "# Lecture 2a: Eigendecomposition of Data and Systems\n",
    "In this lecture, we will discuss the eigendecomposition of a square matrix and how it can be used to understand data and systems in unsupervised machine learning. There are several key ideas in this lecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Eigendecomposition__ allows us to decompose a matrix into its constituent parts, the [eigenvectors and eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors). These values help us understand the structure of the data or system represented by the matrix. We'll look at two approaches to estimate the [eigenvalues and eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) of a matrix:\n",
    "    * __Power iteration method__ estimates the _largest_ eigenvalue/eigenvector pair. Given a _diagonalizable_ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ the power iteration algorithm will produce a number $\\lambda$, which is the greatest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{A}$ and a nonzero vector $\\mathbf{v}$ which is a corresponding eigenvector of $\\lambda$ such that $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\cdot\\mathbf{v}$.\n",
    "    * __QR iteration__ is another approach to compute the eigendecomposition of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. However, unlike power iteration, this approach will give all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. The QR factorization algorithm relies on the [QR decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition), which itself relies on the [Gram-Schmidt algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram–Schmidt_process).\n",
    "* __Buy versus build__: While we will explore these two approaches to compute the eigendecomposition of a matrix in the lecture and associated lab, most, if not all, computing platforms already have built-in functionality to do this computation. For example, [Julia has the `eigen(...)` function exported by the LinearAlgebra.jl package](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.eigen). Most of the time, there is no need to recreate the wheel (and your implementation will likely be worse in space and time complexity). So always buy when given the chance if the buy option is good.\n",

    "* __Scaling__: In [z-score feature scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling), we subtract off the mean of each feature and then divide by the standard deviation, i.e., $x^{\\prime} = (x - \\mu)/\\sigma$ where $x$ is the unscaled data, and $x^{\\prime}$ is the scaled data. Under this scaling regime, $x^{\\prime}\\leq{0}$ will be values that are less than or equal to the mean value $\\mu$, while $x^{\\prime}>0$ indicate values that are greater than the mean. The range of data is measured in quanta of the standard deviation $\\sigma$."

    "#### Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors using QR iteration\n",
    "We can use [QR decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) to compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a square matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. We've implemented our QR own iteration algorithm in [the `myqriteration(...)` method](src/Eigendecomposition.jl). This code uses [the `qr(...)` function exported by LinearAlgebra.jl](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.qr) to compute the [QR decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) (instead of [our `orthogonalize(...)` function](src/Compute.jl) discussed above).\n",
    "* The [`myqriteration(...)` method](src/Eigendecomposition.jl) takes the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ that we want to decompose, along with the optional `maxiter` and $\\epsilon$ tolerance parameters. This method returns the sorted eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvalues organized in [a `Tuple`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#Core.Tuple). We'll process this data and return $\\text{diag}(\\lambda)$ and $\\mathbf{V}$, i.e., the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and the matrix of eigenvectors."
